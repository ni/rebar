# Rebar

Rebar is a graphical dataflow language inspired by concepts from [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [G](https://en.wikipedia.org/en/LabVIEW) (the LabVIEW VI block diagram language).
It is implemented as an addon to the LabVIEW NXG development environment.

See the Contributing.md document for details of how to build Rebar.

See the [Getting Started](https://github.com/rebarlang/rebar/wiki/Getting-Started) page for a introductory tutorial on using Rebar.
